# If you're here, you never removed your code from your USB. If you want it, you can snag it from here ;)

All code will be in a zip file, which you'll then extract, and have forever. If you ever want to snag your code again, it'll be up on Files.serverse.org . Just look for your cooresponding USB and you're good to go. 

## Why isn't my code here?

Your code isn't here because you wiped your drive as instructe! ;) 

## How can I host my websites in the future? 

By using services like github, glitch, replit, or even using a subdomain of serverse.org . If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me. My email is ethan@ekmand.dev .
